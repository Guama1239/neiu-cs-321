# **Application Name:**
## üè•  HappyClinic

# **Project Topic/Objective:**
* Happy Clinic is delighted to announce its launching stage where primary care providers, and their designated agents will be able to provide the important details about their health care facilities and what makes them unique to their patients and to their communities.
  This is the reason Happy Clinic provides this platform where the primary care provider (PCP), or their designated agent (DA) can safely create a user account. This account allows the user to provide a detailed description of the type of facility, and the health care services provided. Moreover, in the event the PCP or DA manages more than one facility, their user account will offer the flexibility to add  facilities along with their unique respective services in a separate but organized entry. Every single entry, its details, and the time of entry will be saved, so the user can retrieve it and know when it was created.
  For Happy Clinic, it is essential to gather as many details as possible from users about their facility in order to provide a selection of tailored database solutions to clients.
  Happy Clinic understands the Healthcare Market field is always changing as far as regulations and implementations or the stopping of health care services.
  Your user account allows you to update the services of any facilities, triggering an immediate action of our software development team to make sure your database retains its integrity and remains regulation requirements compliant.
  
# **Motivation:**
* I appreciate the effort my primary care physician puts into my healthcare; unfortunately, he is still 
writing everything down on handwritten forms: Updates on my health status, prescriptions to be faxed to
my pharmacy, referrals to see specialists, etc. I would love to help him and other health care professionals
to have access to this app with the objective to spend more quality time talking to and understanding their
patients needs than filling out redundant paperwork. In addition, this app will also keep all the patients‚Äô
essential information such as social security numbers, insurance information, current health condition,
and current medications encrypted. So, the clinic itself is in compliance with the HIPAA Act that
requires patients‚Äô information to be protected and private. Finally, patients‚Äô essential information will
be readily available to expedite the paperwork and have more time leftover to improve the doctor-patient
 relationship.
 
# **Server-Side Components:**
* The login information and the user entered facilities are stored in a database.

* Every time a user visits and successfully logs in, the user's entries would be populated retrieving them from
 a database. Then the user would have an option to add, modify, view, and delete a facility.
