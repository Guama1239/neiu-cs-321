# **Application Name:**
## üè•  HappyClinic

# **Project Topic/Objective:**
* HappyClinic‚Äôs objective is to provide a platform where primary care providers and their authorized
 employees input, maintain, and update patients‚Äô information in a more secure, effective and efficient way.
  While maintaining data integrity in compliance with the HIPAA Act, HappyClinic will offer a gateway to
  facilitate and reduce patients‚Äô waiting time at the clinic. HappyClinic will be an affordable tool for 
  individual doctors and their private practice locations to upgrade from manual file systems or file-based
  systems to a modern and more reliable database management system (DBMS). It is important to emphasize that
  HappyClinic‚Äôs user-friendly platform guarantees an orderly and smooth transition of patients‚Äô records to its
  database. The patient receives full disclosure and gives written authorization for his or her information to
  be stored in the HappyClinic‚Äôs database by their doctor or authorized personnel.
  
# **Motivation:**
* I appreciate the effort my primary care physician puts into my healthcare; unfortunately, he is still 
writing everything down on handwritten forms: Updates on my health status, prescriptions to be faxed to
my pharmacy, referrals to see specialists, etc. I would love to help him and other health care professionals
to have access to this app with the objective to spend more quality time talking to and understanding their
patients needs than filling out redundant paperwork. In addition, this app will also keep all the patients‚Äô
essential information such as social security numbers, insurance information, current health condition,
and current medications encrypted. So, the clinic itself is in compliance with the HIPAA Act that
requires patients‚Äô information to be protected and private. Finally, patients‚Äô essential information will
be readily available to expedite the paperwork and have more time leftover to improve the doctor-patient
 relationship.
 
# **Server-Side Components:**
* In order to achieve this objective, the need of a design for database environment arises.
